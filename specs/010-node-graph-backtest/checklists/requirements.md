# Specification Quality Checklist: 节点图拖拉拽配置回测功能

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-02-02
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: ✅ PASSED

All checklist items have been validated successfully.

**Notes**:
- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P3) and independently testable
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases identified cover key concerns (performance, compatibility, UX)
- Scope clearly bounded with explicit "Out of Scope" section
- No implementation details in requirements (FR-011 to FR-037 describe WHAT not HOW)
- Success criteria focus on user/business outcomes (SC-001 to SC-020)
